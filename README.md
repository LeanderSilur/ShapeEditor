# ShapeEditor

Standalone for cleaning up hand-drawn animation svg shapes.  
The purpose of this program is to prepare dense vector graphics created by the *PolyVectorization* algorithm for processing in another software.

I convert animation frames to vector images with [**PolyVectorization**](https://github.com/bmpix/PolyVectorization) by Mikhail Bessmeltsev and Justin Solomon.
